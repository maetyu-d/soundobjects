----------------

OLD MAN: They won’t see us from here… they don’t use this part of the garden. The doors are all round the other… [*he tails off*] The lights are on. They haven’t heard us because if they’d heard us then… Mother would have come out, or the girls, and what could we say? 

STRANGER:	What are we going to say?

OLD MAN: First, we’re going to see if they’re all together. They are. There’s her Father by the fire in the arm chair. And that’s her Mother, half leaning on the table…

STRANGER:	 She’s looking at me…

OLD MAN: [*Reassuringly*] She’s not looking at anything. She’s looking out. We’re too far back under these trees to be seen. But stay here and no closer. Look, her sisters are in there too. They’re sewing. The little one has fallen asleep, look, on the chair. The clock says nine o’clock. It’s quiet… peaceful. They think everything is fine. I suppose it is fine. That’s why they’re silent. 

STRANGER:	 Maybe we could get the father out here somehow? We could make some sort of sign. He is looking out this way. I could knock at that side window? He might hear it before the others did… 

OLD MAN: I don’t know which is better. We have to be careful, her Father isn’t well, her Mother isn’t much better. They’re too old. Her sisters are too young and they love her. They aren’t going to love anyone else like that ever again. They are happy. No. No. Do not go up to the window. That’s the worst thing you could do. 

We need to tell them as simply as we can, as if it’s something that happens every day. We can’t appear too sad, because they might feel they have to apologise to us for having to tell them. They won’t know what to do. 

[*He thinks*]

We will go round to the other side of the garden. We’re going to knock and go in as if nothing has happened. They’re used to me so I’ll go first – I do sometimes bring them some things from the garden, you know, when I’ve got too much. They invite me in for tea sometimes. 

STRANGER:	 Well then you don’t need me. You go, and then you can call me. I’ll wait. They don’t know who I am. I’m not going to be any help. 

OLD MAN: [*Cutting him off*] No – better I’m not on my own. One person telling news like that, then the thing’s been done. If I go in they’ll want to know why, and I’ll tell them, then they will know. Then there isn’t anything else to say. Just silence. That’s the worst part, the silence. So no – better I’m not alone. Because then I can talk about the little details: I can say, her hands were across her chest.

STRANGER: But they weren’t, they were by her side in the water. 

OLD MAN: Precisely. We fill up the silence with conversation. And tragedy becomes overwhelmed by the details. If I go in by myself – whatever I say – there will be the silence. God knows what happens in the silence. But together, we’ll be talking, then they listen to one of us, then the other one, and it will distract them from the unimaginable. Her mother’s in there: she could collapse herself. 

Together, the shock of the sadness will be lost in the extra words. Let people gather round and do the talking so the sorrow comes in little jolts, not the wave. 

STRANGER: Your clothes are wet. You’re dripping.

OLD MAN: No… no – it’s where it trailed in the water. You look freezing, your coat is muddy. 

STRANGER: I was waist deep in the water.

OLD MAN: Had you found her long before I got there?

STRANGER: No, a few minutes. I was walking into the village, it was getting dark so I was keeping my eyes on the river not the road. And I saw something by the reeds, so I came closer a bit and her hair was in a circle around her head, just moving with the current.
 
[*In the room, the two sisters turn the heads towards the window*] 

OLD MAN: It’s like they know.

STRANGER:	 They don’t. They just looked this way. I might have been too loud. But I climbed in to get her, and I held her hand and pulled her to the bank. She looked like her sisters, beautiful. 

OLD MAN: I think more. [*Pause*] I don’t know why… I’m losing my nerve. 

STRANGER: What do you mean? Look, we did everything we could. She’d been dead for at least an hour. 

OLD MAN: She wasn’t dead this morning. She was coming out of church and she saw me, she told me she was going to see her Grandmother on the other side of the river, the side you found her. She said she didn’t know when I’d see her again and then she wanted to ask me something I think but then she didn’t, and she just went. But I’m only thinking that now – I didn’t notice it at the time. She smiled as if to say don’t talk to me anymore, don’t ask me questions. She hardly looked at me. 

STRANGER:	 One of the women said she’d been on the bank all afternoon – they’d thought she was looking for flowers. It is possible that it wasn’t an [*he is cut off from saying ‘accident’*]

OLD MAN: No one knows that. What does anyone know? Yes she was quiet, and everyone knows more than one good reason not to live any more. But you can’t look into someone’s mind like you can that room. We don’t think when we ask ‘how are you’ and someone says ‘fine’ that anything is wrong. You can live for months with someone who isn’t in this world anymore and you don’t pay any attention. And then see what happens. Look at her family, they look like statues – not moving at all – and so much going on in their minds. 

None of us know what we are. She might have seemed fine. She might have said “it’s going to rain today” or “we will have lamb for lunch” or “don’t eat that fruit, it’s not ripe” and what was going on inside. We all say things on the outside and keep the inside things inside. An angel wouldn’t have seen anything, so we stand no chance. 

She was inside there last night, sat with them, looking normal. And we wouldn’t be looking at them like this if none of this had happened. It’s only when something happens that you see things differently, we don’t really see the people around us until the moment when they’re gone. And what was going on inside her to make her say what she must have said, do what she must have done!

STRANGER:	 They’re smiling. 

OLD MAN: They couldn’t have expected her home this evening.

STRANGER:	 He’s telling them to shush – look…

OLD MAN: No one wants to wake the little one.

STRANGER:	 No one wants to make a sound.

OLD MAN: Even the sewing’s stopped. It’s dead quiet. 

STRANGER:	 They’ve put the sewing down…

OLD MAN: They’re looking at the child…	

STRANGER:	 They don’t know we’re looking at them…

OLD MAN: It’s like they’re looking at us now…

STRANGER:	 But they’re not seeing us... 

OLD MAN: They don’t see anything.

STRANGER:	 They look happy, but there’s something… I don’t know what…

OLD MAN: They think they’re safe from bad things. They’ve locked the doors against burglars. They’re planned for everything that they can imagine.

STRANGER: We have to tell them sooner or later because someone will just turn up. All the people around where we left her… where we left her body, what if one of them come to knock at the door?

OLD MAN: Martha and Mary are watching her, the others were going to make something to carry her with. I told my eldest granddaughter to run ahead when they started this way. If we wait till she comes, then she can come into the house with me. I wish we hadn’t been stood watching them all this time. I thought I could just knock at the door and tell them. But I can’t – I’ve been watching them, sat by the lamplight…

*ENTER MARY* 

MARY: Grandfather, they’re coming.

OLD MAN: You’re here? Where are they?

MARY:	By the bottom of the last hill.

OLD MAN: I can’t hear them. 

MARY:	I told them to pray quietly. Martha’s there. 

OLD MAN: How many of them came?

MARY:	All of them wanted to help carry her. They had lit lanterns but I told them to put them out. The family would see. 

OLD MAN: Which way are they coming up?

MARY:	The little paths, but they are walking slowly.

OLD MAN: It’s time. 

MARY:	You’ve told them?

OLD MAN: You can see we haven’t. They’re still sat by the lamplight. Look in there and you can see what life is…

MARY:	They seem so peaceful. It’s like watching a dream. 

STRANGER:	 The sisters moved…

OLD MAN: They’re getting up…

STRANGER:	 Are they coming to the window?

[*At that moment, the two sisters move up to the windows, one to the first, the other to the third, and they rest their hands against the window panes, looking out into the dark*] 

OLD MAN: No one comes to the middle window. 

MARY:	They’re looking out, no, listening out.

OLD MAN: The oldest is smiling.

STRANGER:	 The younger looks frightened.

OLD MAN: Be careful. You don’t know how far the soul comes from the body.

[*A long silence. Mary cuddles into her Grandfather, then kisses his cheek*]

MARY:	Grandpa! 

OLD MAN: Don’t cry sweetheart. Our turn will come. [*A pause*]

STRANGER:	 They’re still looking out this way. 

OLD MAN: They’re looking the wrong way. They could look this way for ever and still not see what’s about to happen. What’s about to happen on the other side of the house. 

STRANGER:	 It’s good they are – something’s coming by the meadows. 

MARY:	It must be the villagers though they’re still too far away to really see them. 

STRANGER: You can see them as they come round the path, where the break in the trees is. 

MARY:	How are there more of them now than when I left? They’re walking a strange way up to get here. 

OLD MAN: Water finds a way. But whatever path they take they will get here. I can see them too. They just look like children playing in the moonlight, so even if the sisters saw them they wouldn’t work it out. Their poor sister will come home, the news will be broken, it’s been moving towards them for the last two hours. They can’t lock it out. We can’t lock it out. The villagers keep walking however full their hearts are with pity.

MARY:	She isn’t smiling any more, the eldest sister I mean. 

STRANGER:	They’re leaving the windows…

MARY:	To kiss their mother…

STRANGER:	 Oh she’s stroking the child’s blonde curls without waking it up. 

MARY:	Now they kiss their father’s cheek. 

STRANGER:	 Silence now. 

MARY:	They’re with their mother.

STRANGER:	 The Father is watching the clock…

MARY:	It’s like they’re praying without knowing they are. 

STRANGER :	Maybe… maybe they are lost in their own thoughts.

[*A pause*]

MARY:	Don’t tell them tonight Grandpa!

OLD MAN: You’ve lost your nerve too. I knew you shouldn’t look at them. I’m 83 years old and this is the first time the flimsiness of life has come to me. I don’t know why they seem so strange to me, sat looking like they’re awaiting the night. But it’s like looking at them from another world, because I know something they don’t. I’ve seen what they haven’t on the banks of that river. It’s the gap. The gap is what I can’t find words for. I want to weep. I did not know that there was anything as awful as looking at this room, anything as awful as this to watch.

They have too much confidence in the world. Separated from the outside world by flimsy panes of glass. They don’t know that bad things happen inside yourself, the world doesn’t stop at their front door. They are so certain of their little lives and they don’t know that others know more of it than they do. They don’t know that I, a poor old man, two steps from their front door know more  of it than they do. That an 83 year old holds their happiness like a wounded bird in the hollow of my old hands, and don’t dare to open them…

MARY:	Be kind to them Grandpa.

OLD MAN: We can be kind to them Mary, but no one has been kind to us. 

MARY:	If we told them in them morning, when it’s light, then they wouldn’t be so sad. 

OLD MAN: Yes Mary… it would be better to leave this to the night. The daylight is easier for sorrow. But what are they going to say to us tomorrow? They would only be angry that we had not told them, sorrow makes people jealous: jealous of those who knew before them. It would be like robbing them of something. 

STRANGER: It is too late now. I can hear the prayers now.

MARY:	They are nearly in the gardens. 

[*Enter MARTHA*]  

MARTHA: I told them to wait across the road. [*Sounds of children crying*] I told the children not to come but they wouldn’t be stopped, and the mothers wouldn’t stop them either, they wouldn’t leave them behind. I’ll go and tell them to stop. No it has stopped now. Is it ready? I’ve brought the ring they found on her. I put some flowers in her hands, she’s laid on the stretcher they made in the village. She looks like she’s sleeping now. I couldn’t make her hair sit properly. I told the children to pick daisies. It’s a pity nothing else was flowering. What are you doing here? Why aren’t you with them? [*She looks inside*] They aren’t weeping! Then you couldn’t have told them! 

OLD MAN: Martha… there’s too much life in your soul. You can’t understand…

MARTHA: Why shouldn’t I understand? [*After a long silence*] You shouldn’t have done that Grandpa. 

OLD MAN: Martha, you haven’t seen…

MARTHA: I will go and tell them.

OLD MAN: Stay here for a moment and just look at them.

MARTHA: You can’t leave them to wait any longer. 

OLD MAN: Why not?

MARTHA: You mustn’t leave them any longer. 

OLD MAN: Come here… look…

MARTHA: They look so patient….

OLD MAN: Martha, look.

MARTHA: [*She turns*] Where are you Grandpa? I can’t see you anymore. I don’t know what to do. I’ll go. I’ll tell them. 

OLD MAN: Do not look again until they know. 

MARTHA: I want to go with you….

OLD MAN: No Martha. Stay here, sit here with your sister and do not look. You’re too young. You would never be able to forget it. You shouldn’t know what a face looks like the moment when Death is passing into its eyes. If they cry out then do not turn round. There might be no sound, and if there’s not, do not turn around and look. You won’t know what course sorrow takes. Perhaps a few sobs wrung from the depths and that will be all. I don’t know what I will do when I hear the sounds. Those sounds don’t come from life. Kiss me before I go to them. 

[*The murmur of prayers is growing louder, some of the crowd are spilling into the garden. We hear whispering.*]

STRANGER:	 [*To the crowd*] Stop here – don’t go any closer. Where is she?

A VILLAGER: Who?

STRANGER:	 The daughter. The bearers. 

VILLAGER: They’re coming by the drive at the front. 

[*Exit OLD MAN. MARTHA and MARY have sat down, their backs to the window. We hear low murmurings from the crowd.*]

STRANGER:	 Be quiet! Don’t speak!

[*In the room, the taller of the two sisters rises and closes the bolt on the door*]

MARTHA: She’s opening the door?

STRANGER:	 No, she’s locking it. [*A pause*]

MARTHA: Grandpa still hasn’t come in? 

STRANGER: No. She’s sat down again by her mother. The child is still sleeping. [*A pause*]

MARTHA: Can I hold your hand Mary? 

MARY:	Oh Martha! [*They embrace tightly and kiss each other*]
 
STRANGER:	 He must have knocked. They’ve raised their heads. They’re looking at each other.  

MARTHA: Oh Mary. My little sister. [*She cries into her sister’s shoulder, trying not to make a sound*].
 
STRANGER:	 He’s knocked again. Her Father’s looking at the clock, he’s stood up. 

MARTHA: Mary I have to go in too, I can’t leave them alone. 

MARY:	Martha, Martha! [*She holds her back*]

STRANGER:	 Her Father is undoing the bolts. Slowly.

MARTHA: Oh! Can you see them?

STRANGER:	 Who?

MARTHA: The bearers…?

STRANGER: No, the Father has only opened the door a little. I can see the corner of the front lawn, a fountain. He keeps his hand on his door like he’s saying ‘Ah, it’s you’. He raises his arms. He’s closing the door again. your Grandfather has entered the room now. 

[*The crowd has come up to the window. MARTHA and MARY half sit up, then stand up and move towards the windows, pressing close to each other. We see the OLD MAN moving into the room. The two SISTERS rise. The MOTHER rises, settling the CHILD in the armchair that she has left, so that from outside we can see the CHILD sleeping.*

*The MOTHER moves towards the OLD MAN and goes to hold his hand, but moves it back before he has time to take it. They try to take his coat, but he refuses, one of the SISTER’s offers a chair, but he refuses. The FATHER smiles an air of astonishment. The OLD MAN looks out towards the window.*]

STRANGER:	 He doesn’t want to tell them. He’s looking out for us. 

[*Murmurs in the crowd*]

STRANGER: Hush!
 
[*The OLD MAN, seeing the faces at the windows looks away. He sits down at the armchair, and wipes his forehead several times.*]

STRANGER: 	He’s sat down.

[*The others in the room also sit down. The FATHER seems to be speaking. But then the OLD MAN opens his mouth, and they listen to him. Little by little the others become apprehensive. Suddenly MOTHER starts and rises.*]

MARTHA: Oh! Her Mother is understanding!

[*MARTHA turns away and hides her face in her hands. Murmurs grow again in the crowd. The crowd tries to look, children cry to be lifted up, and most of the mothers let them.*]

STRANGER:	 Hush! He hasn’t told them yet….

[*the MOTHER questions the OLD MAN with anxiety. He says a few more words: then suddenly all in the room rise, as if questioning them. The OLD MAN nods his head.*]

STRANGER:	 He’s told them. He’s told them all at once. 

VOICES: He’s told them. 

 STRANGER: I can’t hear anything. 
 
[*The OLD MAN also stands up. He points to the door behind him. The MOTHER, FATHER, and the two SISTERS rush to the door, which the FATHER struggles to open. The OLD MAN tries to stop the MOTHER from coming outside.*]

VOICES: They’re coming out! 

[*Confusion among the crowd in the garden. All hurry to the other side of the house and disappear, except the STRANGER, who remains at the windows. In the room the folding door is thrown wide open. All go out at the same time. Beyond we see the starry sky, the lawn and the fountain in the moonlight. Left alone in the middle of the room, the CHILD sleeps peacefully in the armchair. A pause*]

STRANGER:	 The child hasn’t even woken up. 

[*He exits to join the others*]
