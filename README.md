# Sound Objects documentation

This Github repository contains code, documentation and supplementary information for RayGun and INTERIOR: two projects focussed on embedded, procedurally generated audio.

## RayGun

RayGun is a prop prototype focussed on embedded, procedurally generated audio and sound effects (prop sounds) specifically. 
Inspired by the iconic ray-guns and death rays of mid-century science fiction, it has a twin focus: improved responsiveness relative to sample-based approaches; and highly localised, object-like sound diffusion.

* Code (Bela-compatible Pd vanilla format) is available [here](https://github.com/matdwlv/soundobjects).
* A brief video demonstration is available [here](https://youtu.be/udGPyDLBV68).

## INTERIOR

INTERIOR recasts Maurice Maeterlinck’s *Interior* – an 1895 play intended for marionettes – as a generative and largely procedurally generated radio play embedded in a radio-inspired tangible artefact. INTERIOR provides a multi-layered, bi-sensory experience that can be accessed in a number of different ways and, rather than require users to travel to a specialised venue, is self-contained and portable so that it can go to users ‘in-the-wild’. 


* The *Interior* script is available [here](https://github.com/matdwlv/soundobjects/blob/master/Interior_script.md). 
* Project code is available [here](https://github.com/matdwlv/soundobjects).
* Brief video demonstration are available [here](https://youtu.be/wlEpIgW7ZLY) and [here](https://youtu.be/RIccRbGfFNI) (the radio play is different each time it is played).
