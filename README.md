# Sound Objects documentation

This Github repository contains code, documentation and supplementary information for RayGun and INTERIOR: two projects focussed on embedded, procedurally generated audio.

## RayGun

A brief video demonstration is available [here](https://youtu.be/udGPyDLBV68) and can be seen below:

## INTERIOR

INTERIOR recasts Maurice Maeterlinck’s Interior – an 1895 play intended for marionettes – as a generative and largely procedurally generated radio play embedded in a radio-inspired tangible artefact. While RayGun focussed on sound effects (prop sounds), INTERIOR provides a multi-layered, bi-sensory experience that can be accessed in a number of different ways. Additionally, rather than require users to travel to a specialised venue, it is self-contained and portable so that it can go to users ‘in-the-wild’. 

A brief video demonstration is available here:
